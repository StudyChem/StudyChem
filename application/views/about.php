						StudyChem is an e-learning website that will help the students of senior secondary schools to learn chemistry in an interactive and more feasible way. 
						An effective simulation tool will be integrated to the website. This website is basically based on e-learning system bound to chemistry concepts of 9th and 10th standard providing simple, smooth and attractive user interface helping chemistry students to learn basic fundamentals of chemistry as in making study more interesting. 
						This web-application (website) will also provide school teachers a platform to have healthy interactive sessions for teaching purpose. 
						The website will complement the equipped chemistry labs and lectures. It will be more interactive and attractive for learning chemistry. 
						The website will help students to visualize 3D models of chemical compounds and solving chemical reactions which is one of the great difficulties for any teacher to make them visualize in the class. 
						Apart from this it will also help the teacher to conduct online quizzes in class and quickly test the ability of their students in the class and provides the facility for uploading of assignments.  
						The primary aim of this website is for e-learning. The website will also be developed to carry out some daily-routine tasks which were earlier carried out manually i.e., those tasks were performed earlier without the help of lab equipment's. 
						This will help the techers to properly manage the system with the help of server based system and utilizing it for their own needs. 
						This website along with its numerous add-ons will definitely provide opportunities to the student community along with the teachers to set-up new standards in bridging the communication gap.
