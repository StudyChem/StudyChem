<h1>The Theory</h1>
<h2>What is a chemical change?</h2>
<p>In a  chemical change, chemical reaction takes place and the substances undergo a  change in their state.&nbsp; During chemical reactions, one substance reacts with  another to form a new substance. The chemical composition of the new substance  is different from that of the reacting species.&nbsp; Due to a chemical change,  the chemical properties of matter also change. That means the product is  entirely different from either of the reactants. Some chemical reactions may be  either exothermic or endothermic in nature.</p>
<h2>What are exothermic and endothermic reactions?<img src="<?php echo base_url();?>assests/img/HCL.jpg" alt="HCL" align="right" height="157" width="256"></h2>
<p>In  endothermic reactions, a substance absorbs energy in the form of heat and  undergoes a chemical reaction. An example is the heat energy absorbed during a  chemical change involved in cooking, like baking a cake. <br>
<br>
In  exothermic reactions, heat energy is released. Explosion of fireworks is an  example of exothermic chemical change. The explosion releases energy in the form of  light.</p>
<h2>Do you know what a photochemical reaction is?</h2>
<p>Some  chemical reactions do not take place in the dark, but take place only in the  presence of sunlight or other radiations. Such reactions are called  photochemical reactions. The most commonly known example is photosynthesis, in  which plants convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars using energy from  sunlight&nbsp; and produce oxygen as a side product.</p>
<p>A  chemical change changes the identity or property of a substance and may or may  not be reversed.</p>
<p><strong>Examples  of Some Irreversible Chemical changes: </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Combustion  (burning) of fuels:</strong> In combustion reaction, the fuel burns with an  oxidizing agent such as oxygen or fluorine to form new products.</li>
    <li><strong>Neutralization  reaction:</strong> &nbsp;Neutralization reaction is a type of  chemical reaction in which an acid and a base react to form salt and water. For  example, sodium hydroxide reacts with hydrochloric acid to form sodium chloride  and water. This reaction is highly exothermic, which means it releases heat in  the form of energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Rusting  of iron:</strong> Rust is a chemical substance formed by the  chemical action of moist air on iron. It is basically an oxidation reaction.  The formula of rust is Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.xH<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
    <li>Ripening of fruit and cooking of eggs are also  chemical changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are  also some chemical changes which are reversible in nature.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The thermal decomposition of  ammonium chloride is a reversible chemical change. On heating above 340Â°C, it  decomposes to form two gases such as ammonia and hydrogen chloride. On cooling,  the reaction is reversed and solid ammonium chloride is formed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="<?php echo base_url();?>assests/img/phyOrCheChangeEqn1.jpg" alt="phyOrCheChangeEqn1" align="middle" height="28" width="262">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>The synthesis of ammonia from  hydrogen and oxygen is a reversible reaction.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="<?php echo base_url();?>assests/img/cheReactionEqn2.gif" alt="cheReactionEqn2" align="middle" height="33" width="241"></p>
<ul>
    <li>The  synthesis of hydrogen chloride from hydrogen and chlorine is also a reversible reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="/userfiles/1/image/phyOrCheChangeEqn3.jpg" alt="" align="middle" height="25" width="228"></li>
</ul>
<p>Let us discuss about some simple chemical reactions.</p>
<h2><strong>Burning of Magnesium in Air</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="" src="/userfiles/1/image/cheReactionEqn4.gif" align="middle" height="27" width="223">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Magnesium is an alkaline earth metal with symbol Mg. It is a silvery  white metal. Magnesium is a highly inflammable metal and it is easy to ignite  its powdered form or thin strips. Magnesium  burns in air by taking oxygen from air to form magnesium oxide and is basic in  nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Reaction between Sodium Sulphate and Barium Chloride</strong></h2>
<p>When barium  chloride combines with sodium sulphate in the form of their aqueous solutions,  a white precipitate of barium sulphate is formed which is insoluble in water.  The reaction also creates sodium chloride, which remains dissolved in water and  so cannot be seen. The precipitate of barium sulphate is insoluble in dil.HCl.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="/userfiles/1/image/cheReactionEqn9.gif" alt="" align="middle" height="30" width="443"> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, the products formed are entirely different from  the reactants in chemical composition and chemical properties. So this reaction  is a chemical change.</p>
<h2><strong>Reaction of Iron Nails with Copper Sulphate Solution in Water </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="/userfiles/1/image/cheReactionEqn5.gif" alt="" align="middle" height="27" width="351"></p>
<p>When an iron nail is dipped in copper sulphate solution, a brown  coating of copper is formed on the surface of iron and the colour of copper  sulphate solution changes from blue to light green. This reaction shows that  iron is more reactive than copper as it displaces copper from its solution and iron  passes into solution as Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions and ferrous sulphate solution is  formed.</p>
<p>This reaction is  a single displacement reaction.</p>
<h2><strong>Reaction of Zinc with  Dilute Sulphuric Acid</strong></h2>
<p>Zinc is more reactive than hydrogen and it displaces hydrogen from  dilute acids. Zinc reacts with dilute sulphuric acid to form zinc sulphate and  hydrogen gas is evolved. This is a single displacement reaction of a non-metal  by a metal.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="/userfiles/1/image/cheReactionEqn8.gif" alt="" align="middle" height="26" width="330"></p>
<p>The products ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>  (g) are entirely different in chemical composition and chemical  properties from the reactants Zn and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. So, this  reaction is a chemical change.</p>
<h2><strong>Heating of Copper Sulphate</strong></h2>
<p>Copper sulphate  pentahydrate contain 5 moles of water per one mole of copper (II) sulphate. Its  formula is written as CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O. It can be converted  into anhydrous copper sulphate when heated strongly. The blue colour of copper  sulphate is due to water of hydration. When heated, it loses two water  molecules at ~63Â°C followed by two more at ~109Â°C and the final water molecule  at ~200Â°C and turns to white coloured anhydrous copper sulphate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="/userfiles/1/image/cheReactionEqn6.gif" alt="" align="middle" height="31" width="347">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above  process can be reversed. When water is added to white coloured anhydrous copper  sulphate, its colour changes to blue, indicating that the blue coloured copper sulphate  pentahydrate is regenerated. &nbsp;So, it is a  reversible chemical change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="/userfiles/1/image/cheReactionEqn7.gif" alt="" align="middle" height="30" width="296"></p>
<p>On further heating at ~650Â°C, the anhydrous copper sulphate  decomposes to form copper oxide (CuO) and sulphur trioxide (SO<sub>3</sub>) and  the reaction become irreversible.</p>
