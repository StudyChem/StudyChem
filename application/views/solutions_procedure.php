<h2>Real Lab Procedure:</h2>
<h3>Preparation of a true solution of common salt, sugar and alum</h3>
<p>Take three beakers with 90 ml water in each. Label them as A, B, and C. Add 10 g of finely powdered common salt, sugar and alum (<strong>phitkari</strong>) in beakers A, B and C respectively. Stir the solutions in each beaker thoroughly with the help of a glass rod and when ready keep them for further use.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Preparation of a suspension of soil, chalk powder and fine sand in water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Take three beakers. Put 90 ml of water in each beaker. Label them as D, E, and F. Add 10 g of&nbsp; fine soil (without litter), fine chalk powder and fine sand in beaker A, B and C respectively. Stir the contents of each beaker well with the help of a glass rod.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>A colloidal of starch in water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mix 1% dry corn starch with 3 ml of distilled water. To this add 97 ml of boiling distilled water. Stir it well. Heat it for 2 minutes stirring the solution constantly. Cool it and store it for further use. Label the test tube as G.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>A colloidal of egg albumin in water</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Take 1 g of egg albumin (the colourless fluid found around the yellow yolk) and 5 ml of distilled water in a beaker. Mix it well. Slowly add 95 ml of distilled water while stirring continuously. After mixing, add a few drops of acid (dil.HCl/dil.H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>or acetic acid) and stir well. The clear solution of albumin and water will become turbid. Label the test tube as H.</p>

<h2>Simulator Procedure:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>You are provided with:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>True solutions of sugar in test tube A, salt in  test tube B and alum in test tube C.</li>
        <li>Suspensions of soil in test tube D, chalk in test  tube E, sand in test tube F.</li>
        <li>Colloids of starch in test tube G and egg albumin  in test tube H.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>To distinguish between the solutions, under the  ‘Select  Properties’; select any one of the properties (Transparency, Filtration   or Stability).</li>
</ol>
<h3>To check the Transparency:</h3>
<ol start="3">
    <li>Click on any one of the solution sets (True  Solutions, Suspensions or Colloids) to find its properties.</li>
    <li>Click and drag the cellophane paper behind the  solutions in the test tubes to check the transparency of the solutions.</li>
    <li>An information icon pops up. Click on the  information icon to see the inference.</li>
</ol>
<h3>To do the Filtration:</h3>
<ol start="6">
    <li>Click on any one of the solution sets (True  Solutions, Suspensions or Colloids) to find its properties.</li>
    <li>Click on any one of the test tubes to pour the  solution into the funnel.</li>
    <li>An information icon pops up. Click on the  information icon to see the inference.</li>
</ol>
<h3>To check the Stability:</h3>
<ol start="9">
    <li>Click on any one of the solution sets (True  Solutions, Suspensions or Colloids) to find its properties.</li>
    <li>Wait till  the particles settle down.</li>
    <li>An  information icon pops up. Click on the information icon to see the inference.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Inferences:</h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Colloidal       solutions are somewhat translucent and their particles can pass through       filter paper to give translucent filtrate. No residue particles are left       as residue on the filter paper.</li>
    <li>True       solutions are transparent. They pass through filter paper leaving no       residue on the filter paper. The filtrate is also transparent.</li>
    <li>Suspensions       are somewhat&nbsp; opaque or dull. They leave residue particles on filter paper on filtration. The filtrate is more or less clear and       transparent.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Precautions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>While filtering a solution drop the contents along a glass rod into the funnel.</li>
    <li>Keep the sample undisturbed while checking stability.</li>
    <li>Handle acids carefully.&nbsp;</li>
